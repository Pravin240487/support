Hi, Pravin,\
\
This is Francisco, and I would like to thank you for your time on the chat today. It was a pleasure. Here is a recap of our conversation.\
\
You opened the case with questions regarding Workdocs setup with Microsoft AD, and options to have Workdocs for your users.\
\
As we discussed, you need an Active Directory to manage your users, and the Managed AD is one of the alternatives you can use. Here is the summary of our conversation:\
\
	1. Create your users in Managed AD using an EC2 instance with RSAT tools installed. You can follow the steps in this document:\
		\{+\} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_manage_users_groups.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_manage_users_groups.html }}\
		\
	2. After you create the user, you can set your own user as the Worksdocs site administrator, so you can manage it:\
		\{+\} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/manage_set_admin.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/manage_set_admin.html }}\
		\
	3. With the administrator user, you can manage site settings such as storage, and user settings:\
		\{+\} {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/manage-sites.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/manage-sites.html }}\
		\
Finally, we also discussed on pricing [1], and I also recommended the use of the AWS pricing calculator to get an estimate of cost depending on the usage: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://calculator.aws/#/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://calculator.aws/#/ }}\
\
Again, it was a pleasure working with you in this request, and if it's ok for you, I can mark this case as resolved, but if you have any question, feel free to contact me. I will be happy to help.\
\
Have a nice day ahead!\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Hi Arun,\
\
Greetings!\
\
This is Kirubahar from AWS Premium Support reaching out to you regarding the recent Backup case on Tag based backup.\
\
Thanks for your time today over chat session, It was a pleasure talking to you. Let me summarize our conversation below,\
\
Chat was raised requesting information about general question on how backup will treat resource assignment, when both individual resource and a tag filter are used in Backup plan. Also, on how to achieve \'93AND\'94 condition for tags when multiple tags are used to choose resources for backup, followed by question on RDS backup type and retention, and also on the pricing. I have checked these queries and have gathered information on this. I will try to answer these questions one by one below,\
\
1. Under "Resource assignments", if i add any resources and also a tags, how does it filter the resources for backup?\
\
Generally, The backup plans allows multiple resources to be added, aiming to make it easier for customer to schedule backup for a large resource set as compared to having to configure a backup plan for each resources individually. That being said, when a resource and Tags are added to the resource assignment, the AWS backup would backup the individual resources and those resources that have the matching tags. \
\
Inorder to confirm this, I created a backup plan in my lab setup where I added an individual Ec2 instance as resource and also used a tag based filtering. I added this tag to another Ec2 instance. I waited for the backup to start and noticed both the EC2 instances.\
\
2. How to select using multiple tags, I mean we have 100 EC2 instances which are tagged with \'93Environment:Production\'94. In there are around 50 instances which has additional tag \'93Backup:True\'94. Is there way to filter the resources only when both of these tags are there?\
\
I checked this requirement and could confirm that AWS backup currently treats the TAGS as \'93OR\'94 condition and not \'93AND\'94 condition, (i.e) If two tag key value pairs are passed to a backup plan, AWS backup will back all the resources that has either of these tags. \
\
Apologies for any inconvenience caused here. I see that a feature request has already been raised for this feature to the Backup service team, I have reached out to your technical account manager \'93George Niece\'94 and have requested him to add your voice to it on your behalf. I hope it helps.\
\
3. As we know RDS already has an Automated backup which retains maximum of 35 days. When I use AWS Backup, does it create different kind of snapshot which can be retained for 1 year?\
\
With RDS we get two methods of backing up the DB instances, automated backups and database snapshots (DB Snapshots). These automated backup feature of Amazon RDS performs a full daily (once in a day) snapshot of your data during the configured maintenance window. Whereas DB Snapshots are user-initiated and enable you to back up your DB instance in a known state as frequently as you wish, and then restore to that specific state at any time.  \
\
The backup that AWS Backup service would create is that of User Snapshot type and hence can be retained for any customizable period of time. Also these snapshot taken using the AWS Backup service will reflect in RDS snapshot page under \'93Backup Service\'94 tab.  For more information please refer to [1]\
\
Regarding the AWS Backup pricing, With AWS Backup, you pay only for the amount of backup storage you use and the amount of backup data you restore in the month. There is no minimum fee and there are no set-up charges. AWS Backup storage pricing is based on the amount of storage space your backup data consumes. For more information on Backup Storage pricing please refer to [2]\
\
I hope this information is of help to you and clarifies your queries.\
\
I will continue to assume the ownership of this case. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to add them to your reply,  I will be happy to address them.\
\
Have a pleasant day ahead!\

09:46:59 AM Kirubahar : I see that you have few questions related to AWS backup\
09:47:06 AM Kirubahar : ohh nice, I was about to say the same!\
09:47:16 AM Kirubahar : Please let me know your queries\
09:48:38 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: 1. Under "Resource assignments", when we assign the resources, there is an option to add multiple assignment. So, we can either add resources or tags\
09:49:08 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: letsay, if i add any resources and also a tags, how does it filter the resources\
09:50:14 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: does it filter the resources which has that particular tag?\
09:50:20 AM Kirubahar : Let me check this\
09:50:28 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: Sure take your time\

09:59:34 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: 2. How to select using multiple tags, I mean we have 100 EC2 instances which are tagged with \'93Environment:Production\'94. In there are around 50 instances which has additional tag \'93Backup:True\'94. Is there way to filter the resources only when both of these tags are there?\
10:00:08 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: 3. As we know RDS already has an Automated backup which retains maximum of 35 days. When I use AWS Backup, does it create different kind of snapshot which can be retained for 1 year?\
10:00:52 AM Kirubahar : Okay\
10:01:10 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: Also, do we have any pricing for this service?\

\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 \cb3 Hello, \
\
On February 4, 2021 the EC2 Image Builder service team launched support for higher fidelity Image Pipeline schedule expressions. Previously, the cron Scheduling Engine was limited to execute your cron within an hour of the scheduled time. Now, EC2 Image Builder supports cron executions within one minute of the scheduled time.\
\
Additionally, cron expressions supported by EC2 Image Builder now has parity with other AWS Services that support cron schedules, including CloudWatch Events and SageMaker. You now have the ability to use more expressive schedules that include the ability to:\
\
1. Configure the Image Pipeline to run on the last day of the week or month.\
2. Run your cron on the weekday closest to a particular day of the month.\
3. Optionally configure yearly schedules.\
\
Existing pipelines are not impacted because they have been automatically upgraded to use the new scheduling engine and you will immediately notice an improvement in your build cadence.\
\
This change will however, impact creating or updating Image Pipelines with schedules that are considered to be ambiguous.\
\
Ambiguous cron expressions are those that attempt to set conflicting values for day of week and day of month. Below are some common ambiguous cron expressions and their fixes:\
\
A. Every day of month AND Every day of week:\
This needs to be updated to say Every day of month AND Any day of week.\
cron(0 0 * * *) 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  cron(0 0 * * ?)\
\
B. Specific day of month AND Every day of week:\
This needs to be updated to say Specific day of month AND Any day of week.\
cron(0 0 1 * *) 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  cron(0 0 1 * ?)\
\
C. Every day of month AND Specific day of week:\
This needs to be updated to say Any day of month AND Specific day of week.\
cron(0 0 * * MON) 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  cron(0 0 ? * MON)\
\
D. Run every Sunday, where Sunday is specified as a number:\
Sundays were previously the zeroth and seventh day of the day of the week, while now they are first day of the week.\
cron(0 0 * * 0) 
\f2 \uc0\u8594 
\f1  cron(0 0 ? * 1)\
\
We apologize for any inconvenience that this change may have caused. You can find more details about supported cron expressions by visiting our documentation page [1].\

\fs28 \cb3 Best Practices for EC2 Instance Management\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello Arun, \
\
Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support. My name is Ryman and I will be assisting you today. \
\
After reviewing the case, I understand that you are looking for some recommendations on best approaches to install all packages and setup EC2 instances. You have been using Terraform to provision AWS resources, and have looked in to EC2 Image Builder. You are currently considering the following approaches: \uc0\u8195 \
1. Install all the packages and bundle it as a Golden AMI\
2. Install the necessary packages using User data properties in the EC2 instance\
3. Install the necessary packages using CI/CD Jenkins pipeline after the provisioning the EC2 instance through terraform.\
\
Before I make any recommendations, it is important to note that all of these are great approaches that fit your needs. It really comes down to preference of methods, the level of management desired, and use case.\
\
Golden AMIs are a great way to package everything up into an image and easily launch an EC2 instance with all required configurations and packages. The image is stored in a known location on AWS, so you have nothing to manage other than the image itself. If you plan to launch a lot of EC2 instances that require the same packages, than this would be an ideal approach.\
\
Using the bootstrapping with user data approach is more of a manual process, but will give you more granular control over the instance that is being launched. If a package is not needed on a particular instance, you can simply remove it from the user data during launch, whereas you would need to manually remove the package form the instance after launching from an AMI.  With user data, you would want to store the user data scripts in a safe location so they can be retrieved and entered quickly during the launch process, which requires a bit more management on your end. This is a great, granular approach to launching your instances with desired configurations if you are not going to be launching a large amount of EC2 instances. \
\
The last approach of using CI/CD Jenkins pipelines would take some configuration to achieve as well. You would need to make sure each instance has Jenkins installed, and you would need to configure them accordingly. A golden image AMI would have all of these configurations in place, and I will detail in the next paragraph my thoughts on golden image AMI pipelines. I do not have much experience with Jenkins, but it does not seem difficult to integrate it with AWS services [1, 2]. \
\
As I noted, this really comes down to use case, business requirements and preference of your organization. With that said, I feel that deploying a golden image AMI pipeline with EC2 Image Builder [3] would be a great overall choice for many use cases. Image Builder is what we at AWS recommend to customers to manage golden images. With this approach, the ability to automatically provision images as new software updates and patches become available is included, so the image would always be up to date when used to launch a new instance. Another benefit to this is that Image Builder is provided no additional cost, so you are only charged for the underlying AWS resources that are used to create, store, and share the images. AWS also offers documentation on building golden AMI pipelines with vulnerability scanning, with Tenable.io for example [4]. \
\
Finally, I would like to add that you can use AWS Systems Manager to install and update packages and patches on instances [5]. You mentioned using Ansible, and Systems Manager works very well with Ansible to manage EC2 instances [6]. \
\
I hope you have found this information helpful. If you have any more questions, please feel free to reach out and I will continue to investigate these options. Have a great rest of your day. \

\fs28 \cb3 Chat: Fargate spot interruption log\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello Atchaya,\
\
Thank you for contacting AWS Premium Support. It was a pleasure to have a conversation with you earlier.\
\
Please find the summary of our conversation below:\
\
You have reached us as you wanted to know the Fargate task : b83cf0bdc88c4590923f6e6e30ef6e3e was stopped because of the Fargate-Spot interruption and if so if it was a SIGTERM. \
\
During our conversation I have checked the backend logs for the task : b83cf0bdc88c4590923f6e6e30ef6e3e and could confirm the task was stopped with the reason : stoppedReason=Your Spot Task was interrupted and with an exit code 0.\
\
In general an exit code 0 indicates its a graceful termination and the task was killed with a SIGTERM signal.\
\
Later, you wanted to know if the timeout value you mentioned for the fargate task was in place or not, further I could confirm based on the exit code it did respect the timeout value and terminated the task gracefully.\
\
Further, you wanted to know the events in which the task was removed and a new task started, Please find the sequence of events:\
\
1. Fargate task receives a StopTaskAPI from the service scheduler because of the Spot Interruption in place.\
2. As soon as the task starts deregistering in order to honour the desired count mentioned in the service, the ECS Scheduler immediately sends a RunTask API call which launches a new task and register with the Loadbalancer after it starts running.\
3. Meanwhile the old task will be gracefully terminated by respecting the Timeout value configured.\
4. Service makes sure the desired count is met and goes into a steady state after the task is healthy.\
\
Please note the ECS service scheduler does place the tasks honouring the desired count mentioned, it will perform the actions in a simultaneous fashion once the a running task is being stopped.\
\
I hope the above helps in understanding the workflow of the service events. Please let me know if you have any further queries. I would be happy to assist you more.\

11:13:44 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: okay\
11:14:00 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: can you please share me some sample logs of it?\
11:14:40 AM Amitha: so I cannot see any container logs of your application\
11:14:50 AM Amitha: I can just see when the task started and stopped \
11:14:55 AM Amitha: and the reason why it stopped\
11:15:33 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: Also, there were 2 deregistration events at the same time. But 1 task only terminated. Could you please check it and let me know the reason behind it?\
11:15:37 AM Amitha: also due to confidentiality reasons I cannot share these timestamps and logs.\
11:16:59 AM Amitha: its the same task it tried to deregister. It first sent the call and then later tried doing the same \
11:17:01 AM Amitha: again\
11:17:04 AM Amitha: on the same task\
11:19:45 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: I have added the stopTimeout 120 seconds in task definition. I want to make sure whether it is worked or not?\
11:19:56 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: how to find it?\
11:21:26 AM Amitha: well that will be applied \
11:22:54 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: will it be logged? Can we see those logs from our end. Or we can see only exit code 0?\
11:23:32 AM Amitha: yes, for a stopped task you can always see the exit code in your ECS console\
11:23:33 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: is service scheduler add new task when it receives the SIGTERM or after the task served with stoptimeout?\
11:24:30 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: Can we see the timestamps of both the SIGTERM and deregistration? \
11:27:05 AM Amitha: so once a task is being called a deregister it always makes sure your desired count is satisfied and launches new tasks.\
\
give me a moment to check if the timestamps are available on Ctrail. You can check for DeregisterTarget API call in ctrail to check when the service actually called for deregister \
\
Also, with exit code 0 it does mean its SIGTERM.\
11:32:33 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: When SIGTREM occur, will the service scheduler add the new task immediately? or will it wait for the task to serve their stoptimeout and then add new task?\
11:34:27 AM Amitha: I believe it will wait for the old task to completely stop and then start the new task. As that is what is looks from the service events\
11:35:33 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: okay\
11:40:21 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: So the spot task replacement is not following any rolling/blue green deployment right? I mean it will not stop the old tasks after the new task coming to running status right? running task count will be less than desired count when SIGTERM occurs right?\
11:42:27 AM Amitha: do you have any deployment configuration setup ? during creating the service?\
11:44:23 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: By default it is chosen for rolling deployment\
11:46:50 AM Amitha: I mean it will not stop the old tasks after the new task coming to running status right? --> from what I infer from your service events the new tasks are coming up after the call to stop old task has occurred.\
But since you had a timeout value the task was taking time to stop meanwhile a new task was also getting started.\
11:49:35 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: Please correct me if anything wrong here,\
\
1) SIGTERM occurs\
2) task waits for 2 minutes as stoptimeout given\
3) new task added and starts to register\
4) old task starts to deregister after timeout\
5) task stopped\
11:49:52 AM Amitha: yes\
11:49:56 AM Amitha: you are correct\
11:50:32 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: if no stoptimeout then new task will be added at last right?\
11:57:02 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: the service scheduler will receive the interruption signal and attempt to launch additional Tasks on Fargate Spot if capacity is available => seems like whenever service scheduler receives interruption signal, it will immediately tries add new task.\
00:00:46 PM Amitha: so this is the flow :\
\
1)Deregister call occured at : 2021-02-16T19:40:50.523Z\
2) new task call to add from service was at : 2021-02-16T19:41:00+0000\
2) task waits for 2 minutes as stoptimeout given as it is the timeout values.// Meanwhile the Service still tries to deregister by send the deregister calls on old task //2021-02-16T19:41:35.832Z at this time.\
3) new task added was at .//2021-02-16T19:41:20+0000	it registered at : 2021-02-16T19:42:43.066Z\
4) old task starts to deregister after timeout and stops.\
\
This is the exact workflow, so the service does things simultaneously. It will stop the task as well as start the new task but the stop task will respect its timeout and get killed.\
\
if no stoptimeout then new task will be added at last right?--> if no timeout also the new tasks will be spun up by the service and the ECS service has default timeout of 30secs for the old task.\
\
\
00:04:41 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: okay\
00:04:50 PM Amitha: I hope that helps!\
00:05:38 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: The interruption logs are logged in task status only right?\
00:05:54 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: or can I find it some where else?\
00:06:29 PM Amitha: The interruption logs are logged in task status only right? --> like I dint get you ?\
00:06:56 PM Amitha: can you tell me what are you saying if its Interruption logs\
00:07:04 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: interruption reason\
00:07:09 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: exit code \
00:07:18 PM Amitha: yes, that will be on the console itseld\
00:07:23 PM Amitha: itself\
00:07:45 PM Amitha: during the task stopped \
00:08:40 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: so I can see interruption reason only in task status tab and that too available for 3 hours right?\
00:09:21 PM Amitha: yes\
00:09:29 PM Amitha: a maximum of 3hours\
00:10:15 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: okay thanks\
00:10:20 PM Amitha: your welcome\
00:10:47 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/asamina1@optum.com: can you please send the spot task replacement flow in email?\
00:10:57 PM Amitha: sure,\

\
Yes, only the newly created services, tasks, and newly registered container instances after opting in will receive the new format ARN. ARNS of the existing components will NOT be changed as the ARNs can't be changed once they are assigned. \
\
Excerpt from an AWS documentation[1]:\
\
"Only resources launched after opting in receive the new ARN and resource ID format. All existing resources are not affected. In order for Amazon ECS services and tasks to transition to the new ARN and resource ID formats, the service or task must be re-created. To transition a container instance to the new ARN and resource ID format, the container instance must be drained and a new container instance registered to the cluster."\
\
Let me know if you have more queries.\

Yes, you are right. The ARN of the cluster will not change. The change would be only for a service, container instance and a task.\

\fs28 \cb3 Call: Validate Image Builder secuirty features and parameterize during runtime\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Good day Pravin, \
\
Alan here from AWS Premium Support and I had the pleasure of chatting to you earlier, and assisting you with your case.\
\
Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support with your question about replacing your ansible runbook with native ImageBuilder components. You also want to know if you can pass a parameter to a pipeline at the time of execution. \
\
On our call we able to replace some of the parts of the ansible playbook with the following components:\
  - The "python" installation :- Component Name "python-3-linux" \
      URL  - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://af-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/home?region=af-south-1#/components/arn:aws:imagebuilder:af-south-1:aws:component/python-3-linux/1.0.1/1"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://af-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/home?region=af-south-1#/components/arn:aws:imagebuilder:af-south-1:aws:component/python-3-linux/1.0.1/1 }})\
    This component did not do all the tasks done in playbook. It did not install the "pip" package.\
  - The "cis" & "security" playbook :- Component Name "stig-build-linux-high"\
      URL - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://af-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/home?region=af-south-1#/components/arn:aws:imagebuilder:af-south-1:aws:component/stig-build-linux-high/2.5.0/1"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://af-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/home?region=af-south-1#/components/arn:aws:imagebuilder:af-south-1:aws:component/stig-build-linux-high/2.5.0/1 }}\
  - The "update" playbook :- Component Name "update-linux-kernel-mainline"\
      URL - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://af-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/home?region=af-south-1#/components/arn:aws:imagebuilder:af-south-1:aws:component/update-linux-kernel-mainline/1.0.0/1"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://af-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/home?region=af-south-1#/components/arn:aws:imagebuilder:af-south-1:aws:component/update-linux-kernel-mainline/1.0.0/1 }}\
  - The "debug" playbook was informational, so there is not replacement\
\
Some of the "security" playbooks were not able to be replaced with components as the tasks were very specific to the use-case.\
\
Regards the second question about passing parameters to an ImageBuilder pipeline. I was not able to find any method of doing this with current features available on AWS ImageBuilder. I will be raising a new feature request to have this feature included into the service in the future. As with all feature requests I am not able to provide a ETA as these request are queued with the software development team. You will have to keep an eye on the "What's New with AWS?" web pages for announcement.  \
\
I hope I managed on the call and with the above, to answer your questions and provide you with some insights into the cause and solution.\
\
If you have any further questions, concerns or you need any additional information regarding this case, please feel free to reach out to us at your earliest convenience.\
\
Thank you for your time and patience on our call.\
\
Have a great day further and all the best with your deployments.\

We are trying to parameterize the custom components values during runtime. Currently values are hardcoded and we only use run pipeline to run it, however if we wish to change values within component during runtime, will it be possible or any workaround for it?\

\cf2 \cb3 Hello Surendar,\
\
This is Aamir from EC2 Linux team. It was a pleasure assisting you on a chat and a screen sharing session today. Below is the consolidated summary of our conversation.\
\
You reached us as you were not able to connect to the instance i-0d12532ddd713de5c via Session Manager. You were getting the below error when you were selecting this instance in Session Manager: \
\
The version of SSM Agent on the instance supports Session Manager, but the instance is not configured for use with AWS Systems Manager. Verify that the IAM instance profile attached to the instance includes the required permissions. Learn more.\
\
As you had no access to the instances via SSH because of the company policy, we had to troubleshoot the issue via Run commands. As the Instance was online in SSM, we used RUN command to troubleshoot the issue. Firstly, I asked you to change the NACLs and Security group of the instance so that connectivity is fine. Later, I requested you to get SSM agent logs from the path /var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log so that we can see what is the status of logs. However, when we fetched the logs, they did not tell much. Below is the output of the RUN command which we executed for logs:\
\

\
\
Later we tried to see if you could reach to all the below SSM endpoints on port 443. This check was made to ensure that the connectivity is fine with these endpoints. The commands which were executed were as below:\
\
telnet ssm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 443\
telnet ec2messages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 443\
telnet ssmmessages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 443\
\
The first two commands were getting executed successfully, however, the last command was getting failed. As your instance was using VPC endpoints, we had to ensure that there are two SSM endpoints created i.e. \
\
com.amazonaws.eu-west-1.ssm\
com.amazonaws.eu-west-1.ssmmessages\
\
At first I only saw one endpoint and that was com.amazonaws.eu-west-1.ssm. Hence, I requested to create the second endpoint as well. After that, we tested the above telnet commands, however, the last command was not executing successfully. When I checked the security group associated with the endpoint com.amazonaws.eu-west-1.ssmmessages, it had a different Security Group associated with it i.e. sg-0a5b3ca6b2044d295 which did not have any rules. Hence, I requested to change the Security Group and select the same Security Group which was associated with com.amazonaws.eu-west-1.ssm endpoint. When you did that, the connectivity was successful with the endpoint:\
\
Trying 192.168.55.39...\
Connected to ssmmessages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.\
\
However, even after this, you were not able to connect via Session Manager. The Session Manager was still showing the same error. Hence, I asked you to do a reboot of the instance. When the instance was running again after a stop/start, you were then able to access the instance via Session Manager successfully.\
\
With this, we ended our chat on the note that I can close the case as there was nothing pending from our side. Hence, I\'92ll be marking the case as resolved. However, in case you have any other concerns, please feel free to reach us via Premium Support and we\'92ll be happy to assist you further.\

05:58:30 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i need some clarification on above permission\
05:58:36 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: to provide to user\
05:58:52 AM John J: dbqms:CreateFavoriteQuery allows the user to save a new favorite query in the QLDB console. \
05:59:02 AM John J: If you are not using the QLDB service, you don't need it.\
05:59:57 AM John J: All of the API calls starting with dbqms is for the QLDB console.\
06:00:09 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ok \
06:00:15 AM John J: And RDS console.\
06:00:33 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i need to provide dbqms  and rds-data permission to some user\
06:00:44 AM John J: If your user is not performing queries via teh RDS console, they don't need it.\
06:01:08 AM John J: If your user needs to run queries against QLDB or RDS via the AWS web console, then you need them.\
06:01:19 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: actually user is developer they dont prefer the console\
06:01:38 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: they used to connect the RDS through cli\
06:01:51 AM John J: I see. Do you mean things like the mysql command line?\
06:01:58 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: yes\
06:02:12 AM John J: How about QLDB? We do not have a command line tool for QLDB yet.\
06:02:24 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: my actual goal - i want to provide least permission to developer who is working with RDS \
06:02:36 AM John J: RDS only? Not QLDB?\
06:03:36 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: RDS only\
06:03:41 AM John J: Good.\
06:04:43 AM John J: In this case, you should NOT give your user any IAM permissions. But rather, you give them the hostname, username, password, database name, so that they can access the database via either the mysql command, or other SQL clients.\
06:04:50 AM John J: For example, SQL Workbench.\
06:05:31 AM John J: So, the API calls you mentioned are not needed.\
06:05:52 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: what is the purpose of dbqms and rds-data\
06:06:33 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: why are they asking to provide dbqms and rds-data permission \
06:06:40 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: can you guess\
06:07:07 AM John J: If they are given these permissions, they can run queries in the AWS web console.\
06:07:15 AM John J: Not via the mysql command line.\
06:07:20 AM John J: This is obvious very convenient.\
06:07:50 AM John J: We are making our web console easier and easier to use. We can see a lot of customers like it.\
06:08:04 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: if they are having these permission, they dont need to have RDS username and password ???\
06:08:54 AM John J: If they have these permission, they can run queries in the AWS console without username and password.\
06:09:53 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ok ok .. this is the reason ...\
06:10:08 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i dont want to share the user name and password\
06:10:26 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: so better I can provide these permission to run the query\
06:10:44 AM John J: If you don't want to give them the username and password, then you can give them the above-mentioned permission, so that they can test queries in the AWS console.\
06:11:04 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: please tell me, if they are running query from console, which username and password to authenticate the DB\
06:12:14 AM John J: AWS has a SecretManager service, and it stores the username and password.\
06:12:44 AM John J: In this case, the user is using the username and password stored in SecretManager, without being able to see the username and password.\
06:14:18 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: should i create secret manager or it will automatically created \
06:15:44 AM John J: Let me check into that. You are using Aurora for MySQL?\
06:17:51 AM John J: When you use the Query Editor for the first time, you will need to provide the username and password, then we will store them in Secret Manager.\
06:18:16 AM John J: This is described in the following AWS documentation, with screen captures to illustrate the process.\
06:18:17 AM John J: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/query-editor.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/query-editor.html }}\
06:19:01 AM John J: This is mentioned in step 5 in the documentation.\
06:21:12 AM John J: I think your developers asked for those permissions based on this AWS documentation.\
06:22:28 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: one moment\
06:22:41 AM John J: No worries. Please take your time.\
06:23:38 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: so , i should tell user name and password to developer \
06:24:09 AM John J: This is needed the first time. \
06:24:23 AM John J: You can enter that for the first time, if you do not want to tell them.\
06:24:54 AM John J: However, think about the fact that your developers are writing code to access the database, and the code needs the username and password.\
06:25:24 AM John J: So, in a development environment, it is not common that the developers do not know the username and password.\
06:26:31 AM John J: The AWS console is a good place for testing SQL statements, but by the end of the data, your developers will need the username and password so that the code can connect to the database.\
06:27:06 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: we dont need to share the username and password , we can share the SDK of secret manager to authenticate the code to RDS\
\
06:27:19 AM John J: I see.\
06:27:40 AM John J: In this case, the code connects to secret manager first.\
06:28:19 AM John J: However, you should also know that when the code connects to secret manager the code can print out the username and password in clear text. \
06:28:33 AM John J: It is the same as giving the username and password to your developer.\
06:28:52 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ok \
06:28:56 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: no problem\
06:29:11 AM John J: Well, not exactly the same, but when the code has access to secret manager the code can get the username and password.\
06:29:13 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i saw the document, "Resource": "*" \
06:29:32 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: is it very mandatory to "Resource": "*"\
06:32:59 AM John J: Let me double check.\
06:33:45 AM John J: You can limit the resource to specific Aurora clusters.\
06:34:22 AM John J: For example, one IAM user can access Aurora cluster A, while another IAM user can access Aurora cluster B.\
06:34:36 AM John J: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrdsdataapi.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonrdsdataapi.html }}\
06:34:59 AM John J: This is described in the "Resource types defined by Amazon RDS Data API" part in the documentation.\
06:35:27 AM John J: So you can replace * with the ARN of the Aurora cluster.\
06:37:00 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: if i would replace the specific resource ARN, will that be okay???\
06:37:52 AM John J: Yes you can replace the * in the example with the ARN of a specific Aurora cluster.\
06:38:46 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: what is dbqms:UpdateQueryHistory",  ??\
06:38:56 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: dbqms:UpdateQueryHistory", will change any history \
06:39:11 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: details ??\
06:39:33 AM John J: So, in the query editor, you can see the history of the queries you run.\
06:39:42 AM John J: When you run a new query, it updates the query history.\
06:40:10 AM John J: These API calls are described in this documentation\
06:40:11 AM John J: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/dbqms-api.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/dbqms-api.html }}\
06:40:50 AM John J: If you want them to use the Query Editor in the AWS console, then all these are needed for the Query Editor to work.\
06:41:05 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ok thank you\
06:41:27 AM John J: Is there anything else that we can assist you today?\
06:41:37 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: no thank you\
06:41:45 AM John J: Thank you so much for your patience.\
06:42:09 AM John J: I know that you have requested assistance quite a few times today but we we not able to have a conversations like this.\
06:42:29 AM John J: Please kindly accept our apology for the inconvenience caused by these delays or technical issues.\

\fs28 \cb3 How the bucket/Objects will be impacted by enabling Block public access (bucket settings)\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello again Surendar,\
\
Thanks for your time on chat, I have summarised our conversation below for your reference please check :\
\
1. If any buckets created through other AWS services (ex: cloudtrail or AWS Config), by default, bucket policy will allow public access (READ WRITE LIST ) or access to particular services.\
\
> None of the AWS service provides the pubic access on the S3 bucket, when they prompt to create a new bucket in S3, they will ask for your acknowledgment to add the statement in the bucket policy to allow that service to perform specific actions on the bucket or will prompt you to add the bucket policy manually allowing that service on the bucket.\
\
By default, when the create-bucket API is called, no bucket policy is added and block public access is turned on. Which means, there can be no public access on the bucket. If you want to allow the public access on the bucket, it is required that you turn off the block public access and use either bucket policy or bucket/object ACL to allow public actions.\
\
2. If we trun On the BPA, what is diffrence between denying public access in bucket policy and ACL and BPA.\
\
> Block Public Access is the prevention method and denying through bucket policy is action done to handle the cause. By default, there is an implicit deny on the S3 bucket, which do not allow any access unless specified.\
\
The public permissions can be given either via bucket policy, bucket ACL or object ACL.\
\
The end result of using the BPA or bucket policy to deny public action remains same. BPA is used when you want to prevent any IAM user/role to apply any ACL or bucket policy allowing public actions on the bucket. And if there is any public access given on the bucket by ACL or policy, you may use the bucket policy to restrict that access, you may use either of these method to restrict public access.\
\
3. If we would be enable BPA, how we can provide access to others (public users).\
\
Directly, this is not possible. Once the BPA is turned on there can be no public access given on the bucket. However, as discussed on the chat, if you are serving the website over S3, you may use CloudFront service to access the S3 bucket privately.\
\
The CloudFront will sit between S3 and client, using the OAI feature of CloudFront for S3 REST API endpoint, it will use an IAM user to access the S3 bucket. Doing this, there will be no need to allow public read on the bucket, as cloudfront will use the allowed IAM user on the bucket policy to perform GET object operation on the bucket.\
\
The OAI feature works with s3 REST API endpoint and not the static website endpoint, refer [1] to know the differences.\
\
If you do not want any S3 bucket in your account to have public access, you may turn on Block Public Access on account level which is different than providing on the bucket level. This can be done from the S3 console, left menu "Block Public Access" and turning all the four options as TRUE.\
\
Below are the documentations which can help you setup OAI in CloudFront to serve your S3 website :\

05:43:37 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: My name is surendar\
05:44:00 AM Mahin: Hey Surendar, I hope you are well.\
05:44:06 AM Mahin: Let me go through your case\
05:44:29 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i need clarification on s3 buckets policies which are created through other aws services \
05:45:08 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i mean, if cloud trail creating S3 buckets, bucket policies will provide any public permission\
05:46:22 AM Mahin: Okay, how is the CloudTrail creating the S3 bucket?\
05:47:00 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i am creating cloud trail , while doing it asks me to create a new s3 buckets or choose existing one\
05:47:24 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: when i select option to create s3 bucket, it will create S3 bucket\
05:48:25 AM Mahin: Okay when you choose to create a new S3 bucket, it will not allow public access. It will allow the CloudTrail service to push the objects (logs) to the bucket with the help of bucket policy.\
05:48:42 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ok done.\
05:48:53 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: same way for other services as well ??\
05:49:27 AM Mahin: By default, there is no public access given when calling create-bucket API call, unless you/service specifies it.\
05:49:49 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: unless me !!!!! is fine\
05:49:56 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: but service ???\
05:50:30 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: i want to confirm, if any aws services creating S3 buckets, that bucket should not be public access..\
05:51:10 AM Mahin: Services also wont create a bucket with public access, mostly, S3 is used to store the logs of other services and when we select a creation of new bucket it allows that service to access s3. There is no need for public access here.\
05:51:47 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ok , can you please confirm that\
05:51:54 AM Mahin: Is your use case is to not have any bucket with public access in your account?\
05:52:22 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: S3 buckets created through services wont create bucket policy which will not allow public access ?\
05:52:36 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: yes\
05:53:01 AM Mahin: If thats the case, you can turn on Block Public Access settings on account level.\
05:53:34 AM Mahin: From the S3 console, you can navigate to Block Public Access on the left menu and turn it on.\
05:54:02 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: what is difference between denying the public access in bucket policy and turn on Block Public Access setting\
05:56:03 AM Mahin: The end result is the same, i,e restrict pubic access. The BPA setting does not allows ACL or Bucket policy to provide any public access and bucket policy restricts the public access on the bucket.\
05:56:42 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: ojay\
05:56:44 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: okay\
05:57:14 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: If I turn on BPA, how could I host static website\
05:57:49 AM Mahin: You will not be able to host a website in that case, as it requires public read.\
05:58:02 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: okay.\
05:58:12 AM Mahin: You might want to connect your static website with cloudfront\
05:58:20 AM Mahin: which can access bucket privately \
05:58:34 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: yes\
05:58:39 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: I want to \
05:58:54 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: how we can do that.\
06:01:46 AM Mahin: CloudFront is an proxy server, mostly used for caching but it also allows additional feature one of which is accessing S3 hosted website privately using your custom domain name.\
There is a feature called OAI in cloudfront service which can use an IAM user to access S3, so no need to provide public GET on the bucket.\
\
Here is the document : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html }}\

06:03:27 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: If you use an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint, you must set it up with CloudFront as a custom origin. You can\'92t use the origin access identity feature described in this topic. However, you can restrict access to content on a custom origin by setting up custom headers and configuring your origin to require them. For more information, see Restricting access to files on custom origins.\
06:03:51 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: Note saying, we cant use OAI when we configure static website\
06:04:21 AM Mahin: Yeah instead you can use S3 REST API endpoint, which can be used to access S3 objects.\
06:06:05 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: can you please explain \
06:06:55 AM Mahin: Sure, check out this document : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html#WebsiteRestEndpointDiff"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html#WebsiteRestEndpointDiff }}\
06:07:44 AM Mahin: These are two different type of endpoints which can be used to access S3, they have their differences and based on your use case you may choose any of them to serve your site.\
06:11:43 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Contributor/surendar.s@optum.com: Thank you, please update the case with your comments\
06:13:25 AM Mahin: Most welcome, sure will do that.\

Hi Saroja,\
\
Greetings for the day!!\
\
Thanks for contacting AWS Premium Support. My name is Anant from S3 team and I will be assisting you with this case\
\
You reached out today as you need to understand the impact of setting "Block Public Access" over S3 buckets and objects present inside the bucket.\
Please correct my understanding if I am missing anything.\
\
I would like to inform you that when "Block Public Access" setting is turned OFF, anyone will be able to access to the objects present in the S3 bucket from the global internet without any authentication. This will increase the security risk if your bucket contains any sensitive data stored in it.\
\
When you turn ON the "Block Public Access" setting, S3 will ensure that objects never have public access and only the authorized users will be able to access the objects present in the bucket. S3 will validate the IAM credentials for the users and the IAM permissions attached to them and if the IAM policy allows them to access the object S3 will permit the request else the users will receive an Access Denied error. If there is an existing block public access setting that prohibits the requested access, Amazon S3 rejects the request.\
\
Additionally, If an object is written to an AWS Account or S3 bucket with S3 Block Public Access enabled, and that object specifies any type of public permissions via ACL or policy, those public permissions are blocked. Hence if you have "Block Public Access" enabled for the bucket your object cannot be accessed publicly.\
\
If you want to share some objects to the users without making it publicly accessible you can use a Pre signed URL. When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration date and time. \
The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration. Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object. \
\
For more information on sharing objects via Presigned URL, please refer the following documents:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html }}\
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/presign.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/presign.html }}\
\
I would like to inform you that AWS never recommend its customer to enable public access to their S3 buckets unless you explicitly require anyone on the internet to be able to read or write to your S3 bucket. With Amazon S3 block public access, account administrators and bucket owners can easily set up centralized controls to limit public access to their Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created.\
\
Amazon S3 Block Public Access provides four settings. These settings are independent and can be used in any combination. Each setting can be applied to an access point, a bucket, or an entire AWS account. If the block public access settings for the access point, bucket, or account differ, then Amazon S3 applies the most restrictive combination of the access point, bucket, and account settings.\
\
Please refer to the Document[1] which list the steps to block public access for your S3 bucket.\
Please refer to Document[2] more more details about the public access.\
Please refer to the Document[3] which list all the best practices related to the security of your S3 bucket.\
\
I hope the information shared above is helpful. However, should you face any issues or looking for additional assistance, please feel free to reach out to me and I'll be happy to assist you. \
\
Soliciting your cooperation.\
     \
Thank you, hope you have a great day \

Hi Arun,\
\
Thank you for getting back to me. I understand that you want to know when would be better to use AWS Glue and when AWS EMR.\
\
Please note that these 2 services are similar in a way that they both provide an environment for performing ETL jobs(Extract-Transform-Load). Yet, there are a few differences and the use cases vary across the services - as you will see later "You can replace Glue with EMR but not the other way round".\
\
As you mentioned, Glue is a serverless approach where you do not worry too much about the underlying resources which are provisioned, managed and terminated for your. Yet, there are limited types of resources that you can choose from - currently, we only have 3 worker types.\
\
On the other hand, with EMR you have the freedom to install different applications and managed your instances, which adds to the complexity of managing the EMR cluster but provides more functionality to the environment.\
\
So answering your question, if you are solely using Spark for your use-case you can choose either of these services, with Glue having the additional functionality of Crawlers and auto-generated scripts that can help you implementing your logic. Yet, if you want to perform more complex actions on the data including other applications,  you might have to use EMR.\
\
That being said, I managed to find a short article from a third-party provider[1] that makes a good comparison between the 2 services.\
\
Please let me know if you require any further assistance regarding the case or if you have any other follow-up questions on the topic.\
\
Have a great day ahead!\

\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 \cb3 Hi Boyko,\
\
Thanks for your help in clarifying my queries and it was very helpful.  In addition to that, i have a query as below.\
\
1. Based on my research, I understood that we can run the Spark jobs in both AWS EMR and AWS Glue. But, would like to know the guidance on type of jobs suitable for AWS EMR and AWS Glue. I know the benefit of using Glue is mainly it is serverless and can startup very quickly. \
\
2. It would be great if you can let me know the difference between AWS EMR and AWS Glue. When to use AWS EMR and When to use AWS Glue.\
\
Please guide me on this.\
\
\
Regards,\
Arun Kumar R\

\fs28 \cb3 Chat: SSM manager output to S3 buckets\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hi Surendar Samuthirakani,\
\
Greetings for the day!\
\
Thanks for your time over the chat today and it was a pleasure to having conversation with you.\
\
To summarize the conversation, you contacted us regarding the SSM document S3 output related queries, and I had replicated this scenario in my lab and shared the findings.\
\
# Initially, I tried specifying the new S3 bucket name for creation and got the error message "InvalidOutputFolder". Then, I had to choose an existing S3 bucket to capture the run command output.\
\
# In the cloudtrail logs, I did not find any event for this output capture.\
\
So, you need to choose an existing S3 bucket to capture the output. For S3 bucket creation, please create a custom document and use the same. In that scenario, you should be able to get the API "CreateBucket" call in the cloudtrail.\
\
With reference to the public docs, the command output seems to be directly routed from instance to S3 bucket if you have S3 VPC endpoint for instance then this traffic goes through the same.\

\
Based on your confirmation, I am resolving this case for now but please feel free to contact us if you need any assistance. We will be glad to assist you. Thank you.\

\fs28 \cb3 Chat: how to create match patter\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hi Surendat,\
\
Thank you for taking time on the chat with me today.\
\
I understand that you need to match the CreateBucket API calls made from within the account by other AWS Services.\
\
On the chat, we have managed to use the following event pattern. The event pattern allows to filter for all the Cloudtrail events with a vpc endpoint Id specified.\
\
\{\
  "detail-type": [\
    "AWS API Call via CloudTrail"\
  ],\
  "detail": \{\
    "eventSource": [\
      "s3.amazonaws.com"\
    ],\
    "eventName": [\
      "CreateBucket"\
    ],\
    "vpcEndpointId": [\
      \{\
        "prefix": "vpc"\
      \}\
    ]\
  \}\
\} \
\
\
Further to this, you need you find a way to schedule the event rule target (Lambda function) in order to resend the email notification from the Lambda function to you on the next day. I have explained that, Eventbridge will not be able to re-invoke the Lambda function using a past event, therefore I have advised that you set the schedule from within the Lambda code. \
\
You have asked for time to modify the Lambda function code in order to satisfy the use case. \
\
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns, I am happy to assist in any way.\
\
Enjoy the rest of your day! \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hi Surendar,\
\
Fatima here, I was chatting with you. \
\
Just wanted to send you a follow up email regarding our conversation.\
\
You opened a chat as you were unable to see a CloudTrail event for your CreateBucket API. To confirm, CloudTrail events can take up to 15 mins to show in your Event history. \
\
Once you saw the event, we spoke about various field such as userAgent, eventSource and invokedBy.\
\
userAgent: The agent through which the request was made, such as the AWS Management Console, an AWS service, the AWS SDKs or the AWS CLI. AWS internal in this field means the task was performed by AWS.\
\
eventSource: This is the service that the request was made to. This name is typically a short form of the service name without spaces plus .amazonaws.com. For example: AWS CloudFormation is cloudformation.amazonaws.com.\
\
For more information on the above two fields, visit: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-record-contents.html }}\
\
invokedBy:  This is the name of the AWS service that made the request, such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\
-->{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html }}\

I hope this information helps your query. As discussed, I will mark this case as resolved.\

\fs28 \cb3 Call: Implementing credential source\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Greetings again Pravin!\
\
This is Rudolph from AWS! It was a great pleasure working with you, and thanks for contacting us! Kindly see some information about your case below.\
\
You initiated a call because your end-users are using a python script to AssumeRoleWithSAML that updates your AWS CLI credentials file, that is then used for running Jenkins jobs. They are however running into an issue where the session expires during jobs that are taking longer than an hour. You wanted to know how to implement "Sourcing credentials with an external process" [1]. Please correct me if I am wrong Pravin.\
\
[1] Sourcing credentials with an external process  - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html }}\
\
During the call you walked me through your setup and we discussed that the easiest way to solve the issue would be by specifying the DurationSeconds [2] parameter when logging in with the Python script, as long as the Maximum Session Duration for the Role is set to allow the timeframe as specified in the parameter. There is however a Lambda Function that is reverting any change made to the Maximum Session Duration back to 1 Hour if changed. The team responsible for this Lambda Function will therefore please have to whitelist that Role to allow a longer duration if possible.\

\
I have otherwise also looked into [1] above, and it appears that you can indeed specify the path to your Python script, as it appears that AssumeRoleWithSAML does output the "Expiration" field; which has to be present to indicate temporary credentials "and are refreshed automatically by rerunning the credential_process command before they expire."\
\
This however means that the command that is being run, will once again require your end-users to enter their login details, which is likely not ideal, and might result in the Jenkins jobs failing regardless. It does however appear (if your script allows) that it is possible to specify Username and Password parameters in the "awsprocesscreds" [3] script from AWS Labs in the Confg file. Please see below the link :\

[3] AWS Process Creds {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/awslabs/awsprocesscreds"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://github.com/awslabs/awsprocesscreds }}\

credential_process = awsprocesscreds-saml -e '{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://corp.example.com/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx?loginToRp=urn:amazon:webservices"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://corp.example.com/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx?loginToRp=urn:amazon:webservices }}' -u Monty -p adfs -a arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ADFS-Dev\
\
I however do not think that this is feasible, as you have multiple users, and hardcoding their Usernames and Passwords into a config file would probably pose a bigger risk than extending the Maximum Session Duration. You could consider this, and test to see if the job still gets interrupted, but I imagine that this would not be a feasible solution.\
\
I truly hope that the above proves useful, and thanks again for contacting us! Please do not hesitate to come back with any questions, or to open another unrelated case with us!\
\
Have a great coming week Pravin!\

Hello Pravin\
\
It was a pleasure chatting to you regarding your IAM query.\
\
As disucssed you looking for way to extend your session duration for your Jenkin Jobs as the session expire within 1 hour.\
\
I reviewed your authentication flow as we reviewed your AssumeRoleWithSAML federating into your Jenkin application which in turn you using a Python script to generate session credential with one of your selected roles.\
\
The issue with this is specific to the CLI is you will not be able to extend the duration for session due to Role chaining. [1]\
\
*** Role chaining occurs when you use a role to assume a second role through the AWS CLI or API. For example, assume that User1 has permission to assume RoleA and RoleB. Additionally, RoleA has permission to assume RoleB. You can assume RoleA by using User1's long-term user credentials in the AssumeRole API operation. This operation returns RoleA short-term credentials. To engage in role chaining, you can use RoleA's short-term credentials to assume RoleB. [2]\
\
So to confirm role chaining please go ahead set the Maximum duration to a few hours and run your Jenkin session for >1 hour if you session still expire means role chaining is not permitting the session.\
\
Alternative you can either create IAM user credentials for long-term credentials which I know is not deal or have your script retry connection creating a new session after a hour. \
\
\
Please let me know after your tests if you still need further assistance.\
\
I hope to hear from you soon!\

Hi Arun,\
\
Greetings from AWS!\
\
Thanks for going on the chat earlier. I hope you found it helpful in understanding why cluster j-15Z6FB6H83TKO failed with: \
\
=======\
On the master instance (i-08be21c5749c45249), application provisioning failed\
=======\
\
Great news you were able fix the original issue. \
\
I understand that you now have questions on your Lambda.KMSAccessDeniedException. Please correct me if I have misunderstood.\
\
Before I begin I would suggest moving forward to contact the Lambda support team on issues relating to AWS Lambda as they will have further expertise on this.\
\
Saying that I have some experience and as a result I have investigated this issue. I see Lambda functions use KMS keys to encrypt and decrypt environment variables, which are sensitive user data. lambda:Invoke returns 502 KMSAccessDeniedException when the function's execution role does not have permission to use the configured KMS key. Instead of configuring the function to use their own key, most customers select the automatically-created, default Lambda key. They can't delete this key, and our documentation says the execution role does not need any special statements to use the key -- it should "just automatically work". \
\
Usually, this error implies the function's execution role is re-created. When you create a function, change its execution role, or change its KMS key Lambda adds a grant to the key. This grant allows a principal (which corresponds to the execution role) to use the key. If you delete an execution role and create a new one with the same name, the role ARN doesn't change, but the underlying principal does. \
\
After re-creating, the role ARN is the same, but the principal ID changes due to which we see this error.\
\
Workaround\
==============\
Switch the execution role to a different value, and back using update-function-configuration :[2] CLI Command (or API Call).\
\
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME> --role <temporary role value/ARN>\
\
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME> --role <original role value/ARN>\
\
\
Recommendation\
==============\
The function execution Role should be kept intact to avoid this kind of situation, once the IAM role is created you can update the IAM role CLI commands :[3] (or equivalent API calls)\
\
I hope this helps you to solve the  Lambda issue. Please let us know if any further assistance is needed; we will be happy to help. I also request you to kindly rate my correspondence, it only takes a few seconds and it really helps us to fine-tune our responses to suit customer's need better.\
\
Have a great day Arun!\

\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 \cb3 Hi Declan,\
\
I just found where the issue is. I have to pass the correct VPC CIDR to the EMR Cluster. I have changed the VPC's CIDR but didn't modified it in the EMR and that's why this error and i fixed and it looked good now.\
\
Thanks a lot for your help.\
\
But i would like to let you know about another issue which is not consistent.\
\
Error\
\
Lambda.KMSAccessDeniedException\
Cause\
\
Lambda was unable to decrypt the environment variables because KMS access was denied. Please check the function's KMS key settings. KMS Exception: UnrecognizedClientExceptionKMS Message: The security token included in the request is invalid. (Service: AWSLambda; Status Code: 502; Error Code: KMSAccessDeniedException; Request ID: c3501ccf-88c8-4cbf-a4a6-b5db0ef0a6d8; Proxy: null)\
\
But When i re-run the step function, it is getting fixed. Do you know why is that occuring inconsistently?\
\

11:00:01 AM Declan: I believe issue is happening due to a change the Bootstrap is making on EMR node\
11:00:24 AM Declan: Just to test would you be able launch exact same cluster without that bootstrap \
11:00:42 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: Sure. i can do it.\

11:22:44 AM Declan: I know the cause of failure but not sure what is causing this as of now\
11:23:13 AM Declan: Normally I would say failure is happening due to a change that script is making on EMR node\
11:23:18 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: Sure. I will also try to run the same setup in different AWS account to validate\

11:24:18 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: Yes. little strange for me as well. It was blocker for me as it was supposed to release this week.\
11:24:24 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: but got stuck in this issue.\
11:28:26 AM Declan: Ye I get you\
11:28:57 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: So, do you want me to keep this setup available so that service team can take a look at it?\
11:29:24 AM Declan: Would you mind if I took this offline to deep dive see if any networking issue etc. If you can let me know via email if the cluster without bootstrap works\
11:29:40 AM Declan: too it would be appreciated\
11:30:04 AM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/arunkumar@optum.com: Sure. i will do that. I will also try it in a different account and let you know if that is working.\
11:30:26 AM Declan: Thanks \
11:30:36 AM Declan: Pleasure chatting with you and have a great day\
11:30:39 AM Declan: Bye for now\

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 \ulnone \strokec2 Hello Surendar,\
\
Thanks for your time on call and chat. It was a pleasure assisting you. Below is the summary of our conversation :\
\
You contacted us regarding a query where you wish to filter out all the bucket that were created directly by an AWS service automatically (without any consent). Regarding this I informed you that S3 is integrated with various AWS services but they wont create a bucket automatically unless you perform an action or allow the service to create a bucket. \
\
Usually when choosing S3 with any other AWS service, it will prompt you to either select an existing bucket or create a new bucket. Only when you choose to create a new bucket, then the service goes ahead and creates the bucket. To find out who created a S3 bucket. you can search for the "CreateBucket" API call in Cloudtrail and it will provide you all the details (user, time etc). Unfortunately , at this moment, we dont have a direct mechanism that helps in identifying and isolating API calls that were made from a service console to create a bucket. You can however check the user agent field that can sometimes be helpful and gives an indication which service console the API call would have been made as shown below but these fields keep on updating and cannot be used as reliable method to be ascertain that the API call was made from a AWS service console other than S3.\
\
userAgent":"[AWS Console Firehose, aws-internal/3], [AWS Console Config, aws-internal/3]\
\
Please try and perform some test in your sandbox environment before applying the same logic in production. \
\
I hope this information was helpful. Please feel free to write back to us incase if you have any further queries or concerns.\

\fs28 \cb3 Chat: Image builder pipeline failure for windows\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello,\
 \
Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support. My name is Michal from the Windows team, and I will assist you with your case. I hope you're keeping safe there.\
 \
I understand that you are contacting us today, as one of your Image Builder pipeline is unable to complete due to the below error.\
"failureMessage": "another TOE process with ID 2158a32a-8b21-11eb-9a2c-128875c8db01 has reserved this instance for reboot. Cannot proceed",\
    "logUrl": "C:\\\\imagebuilder\\\\TaskOrchestratorAndExecutor\\\\TOE_2021-03-22_15-22-41_UTC-0_71e32ae1-8b22-11eb-8fb5-128875c8db01"\
Please feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood or omit something.\
 \
Above error appeared in Failed automation execution with ID of 760a9810-25a6-4144-93b2-354aec8d7675. That execution is running ImageBuilderBuildImageDocument automation document against instance with ID: i-05192458635f5ca5b.\
 \
I have a closer look into the instance with ID: i-05192458635f5ca5b and can confirm that other SSM automations were executed against that machine as well:\
9ab6283b-2832-4388-ac3a-067582ffb9f6 - with AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage that successfully installed AmazonCloudWatchAgent - 2021-03-22 15:10:04 UTC\
883b3847-77b4-4a89-ae64-b7b53e28d544 - with AmazonCloudWatch-ManageAgent that failed to configure your Cloud Watch Agent with failure that CloudWatch Agent not installed. - 2021-03-22 15:10:04\
 \
That is suggesting issues with the installation of the CloudWatch agent. That installation did not complete correctly and could require a restart of the machine [1, 2]. Can you please perform that reboot and confirm if your Image Builder pipeline completing the process successfully?\
 \
I hope that you find the above information helpful. In case you feel I missed out to address something more to your concern, or if I can otherwise provide any additional assistance concerning this matter, please do let me know so that I can assist you further.\
 \
Thank you, and have a nice day ahead.\

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello Surendar,\
\
Greetings from AWS, Christian here.\
\
Today we had a chat/call over a situation where after you deploy your ECS Service through Terraform, the alarms for step scaling are not being triggered with the warning 'No step adjustment found for metric value'.\
\
There are a couple of considerations that we have to take into place here.\
\
1. Your task is using less than 1% of CPU for the past 12 hours. There will be no scale out with that value.\
2. The scale in metric will be triggered when the CPU >= 5, but you are using less than 1%, again, this will not be triggered.\
\
As from our shared responsibility model, we can't update your Terraform .tf files but there is a good module here[6] maintained by AWS itself that can be used for that purpose.\
\
Now, to fix this in the Management Console, although Amazon ECS Service Auto Scaling supports using Application Auto Scaling step scaling policies, we recommend using target tracking scaling policies instead[4].\
\
To configure basic Service Auto Scaling parameters[3]:\
\
1. On the service page. Choose Update to update your service.\
2. On the Update service page, choose Next step until you get to Step 3: Set Auto Scaling (optional).\
3. For Service Auto Scaling, choose Configure Service Auto Scaling to adjust your service\'92s desired count.\
4. For Minimum number of tasks, enter 1 for the lower limit of the number of tasks for Service Auto Scaling to use.\
5. For Desired number of tasks, leave this value at 1.\
6. For Maximum number of tasks, enter 2 for the upper limit of the number of tasks for Service Auto Scaling to use.\
7. For IAM role for Service Auto Scaling, choose the ecsAutoscaleRole. If this role does not exist, choose Create new role to have the console create it for you.\
\
To configure a target tracking scaling policy for your service:\
\
1. Choose Add scaling policy to configure your scaling policy.\
2. On the Add policy page, update the following fields:\
\
    - For Scaling policy type, choose Target tracking.\
    - For Policy name, enter TargetTrackingPolicy.\
    - For ECS service metric, choose ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization.\
    - For Target value, enter 75.\
    - For Scale-out cooldown period, enter 60 seconds.\
    - For Scale-in cooldown period, enter 60 seconds.\
    - Choose Save.\
\
3. Choose Next step.\
4. Review all of your choices and then choose Update Service.\
5. When your service status is finished updating, choose View Service.\
\
Because your task never goes beyond 1% of CPU utilization, you will see few occurrences of scaling out, try to add load to your tasks in order to cross 75% to see the scaling activity.\
\
I hope the above helped, but if you have additional queries regarding it, please let us know. We will be happy to assist you till everything is working properly.\

\fs28 \cb3 Chat: Image builder pipeline failure for windows\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello,\
 \
Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support. My name is Michal from the Windows team, and I will assist you with your case. I hope you're keeping safe there.\
 \
I understand that you are contacting us today, as one of your Image Builder pipeline is unable to complete due to the below error.\
"failureMessage": "another TOE process with ID 2158a32a-8b21-11eb-9a2c-128875c8db01 has reserved this instance for reboot. Cannot proceed",\
    "logUrl": "C:\\\\imagebuilder\\\\TaskOrchestratorAndExecutor\\\\TOE_2021-03-22_15-22-41_UTC-0_71e32ae1-8b22-11eb-8fb5-128875c8db01"\
Please feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood or omit something.\
 \
Above error appeared in Failed automation execution with ID of 760a9810-25a6-4144-93b2-354aec8d7675. That execution is running ImageBuilderBuildImageDocument automation document against instance with ID: i-05192458635f5ca5b.\
 \
I have a closer look into the instance with ID: i-05192458635f5ca5b and can confirm that other SSM automations were executed against that machine as well:\
9ab6283b-2832-4388-ac3a-067582ffb9f6 - with AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage that successfully installed AmazonCloudWatchAgent - 2021-03-22 15:10:04 UTC\
883b3847-77b4-4a89-ae64-b7b53e28d544 - with AmazonCloudWatch-ManageAgent that failed to configure your Cloud Watch Agent with failure that CloudWatch Agent not installed. - 2021-03-22 15:10:04\
 \
That is suggesting issues with the installation of the CloudWatch agent. That installation did not complete correctly and could require a restart of the machine [1, 2]. Can you please perform that reboot and confirm if your Image Builder pipeline completing the process successfully?\
 \
I hope that you find the above information helpful. In case you feel I missed out to address something more to your concern, or if I can otherwise provide any additional assistance concerning this matter, please do let me know so that I can assist you further.\
 \
Thank you, and have a nice day ahead.\

\fs28 \cb3 Chat: Setup Excel in AppStream\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello Navaneethan,\
\
Thank you very much for your time today on our chat.  In summary, you had some questions about running Microsoft Excel in an AWS AppStream 2.0 fleet and initiated a chat to help get answers from Premier Support.\
\
I started out by confirming that licensing for Office is going to be the main point here.  Licensing for AppStream does require some special considerations, due to the fact that streaming instances will be replaced daily or more often depending on your configuration. An active session will connect to an available streaming instance, once the session is ended and the disconnect time out is reached, the streaming instance is terminated and will be replaced with a new one as needed based on your scaling policies. Users will not share a streaming instance, session to instance is a 1 to 1 mapping (very much like WorkSpaces).\
\
Keeping this information in mind, we do have other customers who have successfully deployed Office on AppStream. You will need to ensure that it is configured for shared activation as shown following the below URL :\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-shared-computer-activation-for-office-365-proplus"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-shared-computer-activation-for-office-365-proplus }}\
\
This next URL shows you how to adjust registry key components prior to creating the Image Builder that you can update to your fleet:\
\
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/educloud/2015/03/20/how-to-setup-shared-computer-activation-step-by-step-for-your-education-environment/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/educloud/2015/03/20/how-to-setup-shared-computer-activation-step-by-step-for-your-education-environment/ }}\
\
  Note: AppStream instance requires internet access to contact the Office Licensing Service on the Internet to obtain or renew a licensing token.\
\
The link below also provides some more information on Office365 running VDI:\
\
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.microland.com/insights/blogs/deploying-office-365-how-it-is-different-for-vdi"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://www.microland.com/insights/blogs/deploying-office-365-how-it-is-different-for-vdi }}\
\
If you do have more specific questions regarding office365 licensing, Microsoft is going to be the best point of contact, as the same product can be licensed in multiple ways, and you will need to know what is or is not supported by your license model.\
\
Once your licensing model is decided on and a plan is purchased, you can then use the following documentation link in order to launch your Image Builder to install o365 on and then create an image and fleet for use:\

02:29:40 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Sure. Thanks!\
02:29:45 PM Cory L.: I see you had some questions about configuring Microsoft Excel for Appstream\
02:30:13 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: That's right\
02:32:44 PM Cory L.: Ok just a few moments while I review this and then we can continue.\
02:32:53 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Sure. No problem.\
02:37:56 PM Cory L.: Ok so I did want to start off by letting you know that currently it only looks like office365 apps are compatible with AppStream from a licensing perspective.  We always recommend our customers to check with their Microsoft Licensing provider and or support to confirm the licensing requirements for non-o365 installations.\
02:39:05 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Oh alright! But, wouldn't Excel be a part of Office365 app?\
02:39:18 PM Cory L.: Yes that is correct.\
02:40:22 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Sorry but what are the apps that come under office365?\
02:40:41 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Because I see that Excel seems to be a part of it. Not sure if I'm wrong\
02:40:54 PM Cory L.: I know the 4 core are Word, Access, Excel and Outlook.  I have not checked in a while so that may have changed,.\
02:41:09 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Got it\
02:42:36 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: So, to confirm Excel can be configured through AppStream. But, for the license we would need to reach out to Microsoft?\
02:42:47 PM Cory L.: That is correct.\
02:42:57 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Great\
02:43:29 PM Cory L.: Specifically there is a "shared activation" that needs to be configured for it to  be activated properly in AppStream.\
02:43:30 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: So, once we get the license from Microsoft are there a list of steps available to set that up through Appstream?\
02:43:41 PM Cory L.: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-shared-computer-activation-for-office-365-proplus"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/overview-of-shared-computer-activation-for-office-365-proplus }}\
02:43:56 PM Cory L.: I will include any links and documentation as well in an email summary of the case.\
02:44:32 PM Cory L.: Once you have your o365 plan all set, you can then just use the normal AWS user guide to setup your first Image Builder.\
02:45:12 PM Cory L.: Is Excel a hard requirement?\
02:45:24 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Unfortunately yes\
02:45:39 PM Cory L.: You may have a simpler solution using a open source spreadsheet app\
\
02:45:44 PM Cory L.: ah yeah I understand.\
02:46:04 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: There are some custom macros that are written in Excel..\
02:46:08 PM Cory L.: gotcha\
02:48:20 PM Cory L.: So essentially, you would need to purchase your o365 plan.  Then configure the Image Builder and make the needed changes so that each fleet instance created from that image can activate o365.  Then each AppStream instance in the fleet would use internet access to contact the Office Licensing Service on the Internet to obtain or renew a licensing token whenever it is launched.\
\
02:49:20 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Sure yeah then the first step would be to get the license for O365 from my end.\
02:49:22 PM Cory L.: I have a couple of more reference links, I can put them in this chat or just include them in an email summary for you.\
02:49:25 PM Cory L.: Correct.\
02:49:47 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Yeah probably it would be better if you can put the references in the email\
02:50:05 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: one additional question on Appstream\
02:50:15 PM Cory L.: Sure thing, one is a 3rd party blog post going over differences for o365 and how it is different for VDI deployments (appstream2.0)\
02:50:41 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Can we host a custom application and configure it through Appstream?\
02:50:55 PM Cory L.: and the others will be walkthroughs for setting up appstream once you get the licensing and installation directions from Microsoft.\
02:51:00 PM Cory L.: You certainly can.\
02:51:09 PM Cory L.: Pretty much any app works in AppStream.\
02:51:18 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Great\
02:52:03 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: So, we have to build our Image with the application configured in it and then use it through Appstream?\
02:52:38 PM Cory L.: Yep you setup the image builder first - get the apps installed and use it to test how the app will work in appstream.\
02:53:35 PM Cory L.: then, you tell the image builder to make a new image, it shuts down and goes through that processess.  Once done, you can then use that image to configure the fleet.\
02:54:18 PM Cory L.: Then a 'stack' gets created, this holds the sign-on options and a few other settings, and the fleet gets assigned to that stack.  Then you're done.\
02:54:49 PM Cory L.: Image > Fleet > Stack  in that order.\
02:55:51 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Great thanks for the explanation\
02:56:15 PM Cory L.: If you would like to play around with AppStream in the meantime and test other apps to get a feel for it.  We have a "Try it now" feature for appstream which will walk you through setting up a sample app and seeing how the Solution works.\
02:57:07 PM Cory L.: I'll include a link as well in my summary for that in case you wanted to test it with a free app like Notepad or an internet browser first just to see how AppStream works and functions.\
02:57:35 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Yeah I was trying out the free sample apps that was present in there.\
02:57:58 PM Cory L.: oh awesome, then you probably already got a feel for how it goes then.\
02:58:08 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Yup that's right\
02:58:46 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: But, that link in Summary would definitely help as well.\
02:58:56 PM Cory L.: Most definitely.\
02:59:09 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Will probably go over them and reach out out if I have additional questions n it.\
02:59:18 PM Cory L.: Ok so I will get together links and documentation on things we discussed on the chat\
02:59:27 PM Cory L.: Perfect, I was about to ask if there was anything else I could help with.\
02:59:54 PM Cory L.: If not then feel free to close the chat window when ready.  Have a great rest of your day and I will get this summary of our chat over shortly.\
03:00:00 PM Cory L.: Thank you!\
03:00:14 PM assumed-role/AWS_165387667510_Owner/ngunasek@optum.com: Sure thank you so much!\

\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hi,\
\
Thank you for contacting AWS support. My name is Abraham and I will be supporting you on this case.\
\
I understand that you want to set up autoscaling for your ECS service.\
\
I shared a blog article [1] which guides you in setting up autoscaling for ECS, but you could not find the Auto Scaling option on your ECs console. We tried performing a screenshare via Chime but this was not successful (screensharing took a long time to load and then terminated by itself).\
\
You indicated that you were going to call in later again should you require assistance via a screenshare. I am transferring this case to the ECS team to assist you with setting up autoscaling for your ECS clusters as they are more familiar with the ECS console.\
\
Should you have any additional questions, thoughts, concerns or queries please don't hesitate to ask. \
\

\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Hello Saroja, \
\
Thank you for writing back and sharing your concerns with us. \
\
I apologize for the inconvenience caused because of this. Please find the answers to your concerns below. \
\
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
\
- In this case, am I not supposed to be communicated about the status by AWS?\
\
As per the link provided ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://pages.awscloud.com/AQUA_Preview.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://pages.awscloud.com/AQUA_Preview.html }}), to evaluate AQUA, you need to run on Amazon Redshift RA3 nodes in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and US East (Ohio) regions and apply to participate in the AQUA preview by filling out the form. Due to the absence of an RA3 instance, the email with further instructions could not be sent. \
\
-May I now how much costs to launch a new RA3 cluster?\
 \
You can use the below mentioned link to use the pricing calculator and get details on RA3 node type pricing. \

{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/#Pricing_calculator"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \strokec4 https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/#Pricing_calculator }}\
\
-What is planned date for AQUA live?\
I reached out to the AQUA team and have been informed that AQUA will be live in a couple of upcoming weeks. To set the right expectations, I cannot provide an exact date for the release. \
\

Hello Saroja, \
\
Thank you for writing back. I hope you are doing well. \
\
I understand that you signed up for AQUA as guided but have not heard back from AWS after signing up. You want to know the reason behind this and the expected timeline for a response. \
\
I went ahead and contacted the AQUA team for this issue and have the following update for you. \
\
There's only one DC2 cluster in the account provided and AQUA only works with RA3 16XL and 4XL nodes. Also, AQUA is currently in preview mode, therefore, it should never be used in production. To access AQUA, you need to launch a new RA3 cluster. Please confirm with us if you are okay with launching the recommended cluster as it can incur additional charges. Once we receive your confirmation, we will go ahead and enable AQUA access for you.   \
\
Please let me know if it works for you or if you have any other questions and I will be happy to help. Have a great day!\

\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl480\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs33\fsmilli16800 \cf2 Dear Ramkumar ,\
\
Thank you for your time . We had a productive screenshare session , where we did below steps .\
\
=> We have created a new SNS Topic with standard subscription and choose email as subscription type and confirmed the subscription status .\
=> Then we create event subscription in RDS dashboard and opted for previous SNS topic .\
=> Then we restarted database "dts-mysql-01" and "dts" and observed email as event notification .\
\
As discussed we can follow below docs for creating the subscription[1] and filter out the required events as per our need[2] .\
\
Reference :\

\
I hope above is helpful to you in event subscription . Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any further clarification or information. I will be glad to help you to the best of my abilities  !\
\
Thank you for the kind understanding.  Be safe & have a great day ahead !\

Hello Surendar,

It's Napoleone from AWS Premium Support. Hope you are having a great day so far.

First and foremost, thank you for your kindness and collaboration over our chat. It was very appreciated.

With the following, I am going to summarize what we discussed while we were connected. You reached out since you were having issues in getting parameters correctly. Indeed, you have a Lambda function that is being triggered by the following Step Function: "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:165387667510:stateMachine:nonprod_on-demand-surendar_on_demand_emr". The Lambda is returning different parameters in order to create an EMR cluster. However, they are not integers as expected, but they are returned as string. For this reason, the executions are failing, and EMR cluster is never created.

I dove deeper into your issue, and collaborated with a colleague of mine. However, the way the Step Function is defined is correct, hence no issues here:
"ComputeLimits": {
                        "UnitType": "InstanceFleetUnits",
                        "MinimumCapacityUnits.$": "$.minimumcapacityunits",
                        "MaximumCapacityUnits.$": "$.maximumcapacityunits",
                        "MaximumOnDemandCapacityUnits.$": "$.maximumondemandcapacityunits",
                        "MaximumCoreCapacityUnits.$": "$.maximumcorecapacityunits"
                    }

As a matter of fact, we both noticed that the parameters returned by the Lambda function are already strings. I replicated this in my own environment, and I have the following Lambda function that is triggered by a Step Function of mine:
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    value1 = "1"
    value2 = "2"
    value3 = "3"
    return {
        "value1": int(value1),
        "value2": int(value2),
        "value3": int(value3)
    }

However, the three variables are properly converted to integer, as you can see in the attachment. Therefore, may I ask you to kindly ensure you are returning the parameters as integers correctly in the Lambda function?

Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any more questions or concerns and I will be happy to assist you.

I wish you a great day ahead!

Dear customer, thank you for contacting AWS premium support. This is Mahadi and I am here to assist you today.

I understand you wanted to move from Zeppelin to an AWS Managed service. Here is my inputs and use-cases.

For use-cases similar to Zeppelin,  EMR Notebook which is AWS manages is great option[1-2]. For example if you are running interactive job development then EMR notebook is great choice. In addition EMR studio is also great choice for multiple users since EMR studio provides features like authenticating users with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Here is documentation of key EMR studio features[3]. Also note that EMR Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy for data scientists and data engineers to develop, visualize, and debug data engineering and data science applications written in R, Python, Scala, and PySpark. So EMR studio is just wrapper around Juypter Notebook, so it is wrapper around EMR Notebook with extra key features[3-4].

For ETL use-cases, then Glue with SageMaker would be better option[5]. I won't be able to give you more details regarding Glue and SageMaker since I am EMR engineer so I would recommend you to open tickets to the Glue/SageMaker teams and they will be able to give you more details for the best use-cases for these services. 

In addition, you can also use EMR with Zeppelin when creating the EMR cluster[6-7]

I hope this information is helpful to you, please let me know if you have questions.

Hi Team,

We have been using Zeppelin for running our on-demand Sparks jobs(On-prem) on top of our EMR Cluster. We wanted to move this to an AWS Managed service. 

Based on the quick research, we found AWS EMR Notebook maybe a good alternative. But, also it looks we can use Sagemaker Notebook with Glue Dev endpoint. Also, based on the recommendation from some blog, it seems AWS EMR Studio is better than EMR Notebook. Also, the final option would be running Zeppelin on EC2 if no other options are good.

Now, I wanted some inputs from your team on the differences between these solutions. Which would work better for different use-cases?

Dear Customer,

Thank you for reaching out to AWS Premium Support. It was nice interacting with you on chat/call today. Please find the summary of the discussion as below: 
 
I understand that you reached out to us as you are concerned about how to apply scale policy to EMR cluster using step function. Please correct me if I have missed or misunderstood something.

Please checkout the sample format on the attached file (sample.json). As per the sample file it will try to launch an EMR cluster with 1 master node, 1 core node as well as 1 TASK node and it will add an auto scaling on the TASK instance group where it's requesting a minimum of 1 instance and maximum of 5 instances. I am triggering the scale out on YARNAvailablememory. Please note that I am currently not attaching any scale in rule in the cluster. One can follow similar procedure to add a scale in. I trust you will find the attached file useful. 

Please check out this AWS documentation on using EMR managed scaling and automatic-scaling in Amazon EMR [1][2]. You can also check the benefits of managed scaling in this AWS big data blog [3]. Please refer third party article [4] to understand how to Launch an EMR managed scaling cluster with Step Functions. 

We also discussed about EMR managed scaling, autoscaling, various parameters which plays major role in scaling and how to configure it. 

As discussed, I’m marking this case as ‘Resolved’.  Feel free to open a new case in case of any other issue for better case management.  

I hope the above information helps. Please feel free to get back to us in case of any further queries and concerns and I shall be glad to assist you further.

Stay safe and have a nice day!

Hello

Greetings!

Thank you for immense patience while the internal team was looking at the issue.

As per the internal team, the reason you are getting this error is because you have set  [“encrypted”: false] in the container recipe even though the custom AMI ami-077be682d8f131d6b is in encrypted state.

Please allow me to mention that you can’t create an unencrypted volume from an encrypted snapshot. That is the the reason for failure and the is conveyed by the error message “Cannot create unencrypted device /dev/xvda from encrypted snapshot” for the Docker one.

—————————————————
  “instanceConfiguration”: {
            “image”: “ami-077be682d8f131d6b”,
            “blockDeviceMappings”: [
                {
                    “deviceName”: “/dev/xvda”,
                    “ebs”: {
                        “encrypted”: false,
                        “deleteOnTermination”: true,
                        “iops”: null,
                        “kmsKeyId”: null,
                        “snapshotId”: “snap-063b73eebf3ecebdf”,
                        “volumeSize”: 8,
                        “volumeType”: “gp2”
                    },
                    “virtualName”: null,
                    “noDevice”: null
                }
         —————————————————

However, in the In the AMI recipe,  a KMS key is specified in the storage options. That is why it is not failing there.

         —————————————————

  “parentImage”: “ami-077be682d8f131d6b”,
        “blockDeviceMappings”: [
            {
                “deviceName”: “/dev/xvda”,
                “ebs”: {
                    “encrypted”: true,
                    “deleteOnTermination”: true,
                    “iops”: 1500,
                    “kmsKeyId”: “arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:165387667510:key/fe8be482-6484-4f20-b01b-346e84993182”,
                    “snapshotId”: null,
                    “volumeSize”: 30,
                    “volumeType”: “io1”
                },
                “virtualName”: null,
                “noDevice”: null
            }
        ],
         —————————————————

Therefore, I would request you to retry the container recipe with the encryption enabled and see if it works.

I hope I was able to assist you today.  If you have any further queries/concerns, please do reach out. I will be more than happy to address them.

Take care and Be safe!

Hello,

Greetings.

Thank you for your time on chat session and for the continued patience while the internal team was looking at your query.

Please allow me to address your queries one by one for clarity. I am clubbing the related queries together:

——————————————————
1. EC2 Imager builder pipeline currently don’t let me to update the Metadata Version as V2, during EC2 getting created during pipeline run.
2. Also, unable to increase Meta data hoplimit value as 2 during the intermittent EC2 creation during pipeline run.
——————————————————

As mentioned on the chat, the internal team has confirmed that currently there is no direct way to do update the Metadata Version 2 and Hoplimit value in the Image Builder console and a feature request for has already in place.  While I would not be able to guarantee this features availability, it is something they can review to determine its feasibility thereafter, determine implementation.

I would not be able to provide an ETA on when the feature will be added however, you can monitor the AWS Features blog for all updates on AWS:

	[+] https://aws.amazon.com/new/  

As a workaround, the internal team suggested to accomplish your use-case by setting the InstanceMetadataOptions object in the Infrastructure Configuration as below

	--instance-metadata-options
	httpTokens=required,httpPutResponseHopLimit=<give a hop limit>

For more details, you can refer the below document:

	[+]  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/APIReference/API_CreateInfrastructureConfiguration.html#imagebuilder-CreateInfrastructureConfiguration-request-instanceMetadataOptions 
	[+] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/imagebuilder/create-infrastructure-configuration.html 

——————————————————
3. Encrypted AMI when passed to Image builder pipeline of type docker, it fails with error stating as “Cannot create unencrypted device /dev/xvda from encrypted snapshot”. However, when passing the same AMI to image builder of type AMI it works fine. 
——————————————————

Regarding this issue, I have already reached out to the internal team. I will get back to you as soon as I hear from them. I will do my best to make sure this gets the attention it needs, though please note that it may take some time before we have the first response from this team, till then I will keep this case locked to myself.

Alternatively, if you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to write back to us. I will be happy to assist you with the queries. 

Thank you for your understanding. Your patience is highly appreciated.
(Flipping the case to "Pending Amazon Action" till then)

Hi Soumya,

I am quickly summarizing the issues we face and looking for any workaround to get things work,

1. EC2 Imager builder pipeline currently don't let me to update the Metadata Version as V2, during EC2 getting created during pipeline run.
2. Also, unable to increase Meta data hoplimit value as 2 during the intermittent EC2 creation during pipeline run.
3. Encrypted AMI when passed to Image builder pipeline of type docker, it fails with error stating as "Cannot create unencrypted device /dev/xvda from encrypted snapshot". However, when passing the same AMI to image builder of type AMI it works fine. 

Looking for some workaround or get the feature updated so that we can push the pipeline to end users.

Thanks,
Pravin
